# Rounds-Documentation
A project with the hope of documenting the the classes of functions of the game ROUNDS with the hope of aiding in modding


# What this is:
The goal of this project is to eventually be an orginized set of explinations of how the difrent parts of the game's source code works. I will be attempting to lay out the documentation in a similar format to API documents. 
Listing both what difrent feids and functions do. As well as which ones dont function in the base game.
The documentation will start with the most commonly used classes and expand out from there.
Contrubution from the community is highly encureged as this is a large undertaking. If you wish to contribute, you can either make a pull request, or open an issue with the changes/additions. 


# What this isn't:
This is not a documentation of mods for the game. 
The documentation may list some function or feld as non-functional, in that case there may exist a patch to allow for it's use. I won't be cataloging any such patches.
It is the onus of the reader to check if a mod exists to let them do something not available in the base game.
The reason for this is that I want this project to eventualy reach a state that can be called "done." If it was to include documantaion for patches or other mods, it would need to be updated every time a new patch came out; lest it give the impresion that no such mod existed.
